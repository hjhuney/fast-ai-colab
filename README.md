# fast.ai courses

This repo contains my code from [fast.ai](https://fast.ai) deep learning courses taught by Jeremy Howard and Rachel Thomas.  While the course was taught using Jupyter Notebooks on Paperspace, I have translated it to work on Google Colab using the free GPU availability. 

Before running a deep learning notebook on Colab, remember to turn the GPU on. To run the GPU on Colab, go to the "Runtime" tab, then "Change Runtime Type". Under "Hardware Accelerator", select the "GPU" option.
